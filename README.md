Hi. This repository contains my soultions of the tasks from DataStructure course on Stepik.com platform.
Here's link to this course. https://stepik.org/course/55971/info
I hope that my future employers will check-out and evaluate solutions that confirm my ability to write clean and readable code, my way of thinking, and gradually progress in programming overall.
Considering actuality of English and its importance for IT, all my comments and commits will be in English.
Thanks for watching.
